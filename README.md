# Metasploit
Python scripts can use libraries like msfrpc to communicate with the Metasploit Framework via its JSON-RPC API. This enables developers to automate tasks, perform scans, exploit vulnerabilities, and manage sessions programmatically. For example, a Python script could be written to automate the launching of exploits against a target system, gather information, and handle the results.
Here's a simple example of using Python to interact with Metasploit Framework through its JSON-RPC API:
This script connects to the Metasploit RPC service, lists available exploits, launches an exploit against a target IP and port, and then checks for active sessions.
With such scripting capabilities, Python can be effectively used alongside Metasploit Framework for automation, custom tool development, and integration into larger security workflows.
